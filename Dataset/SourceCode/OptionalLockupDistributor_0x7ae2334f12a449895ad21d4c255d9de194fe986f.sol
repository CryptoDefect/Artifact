/**

 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed

 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an

 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer

 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.

 *

 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be

 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in

 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.

 *

 * For example:

 *

 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]

 * ```

 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {

 *     function initialize() initializer public {

 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");

 *     }

 * }

 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {

 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {

 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");

 *     }

 * }

 * ```

 *

 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as

 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.

 *

 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure

 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.

 *

 * [CAUTION]

 * ====

 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.

 *

 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation

 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke

 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:

 *

 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]

 * ```

 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor

 * constructor() {

 *     _disableInitializers();

 * }

 * ```

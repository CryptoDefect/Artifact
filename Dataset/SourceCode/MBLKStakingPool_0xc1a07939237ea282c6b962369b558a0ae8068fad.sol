/**

 * @dev Interface of the ERC20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in

 * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[EIP-2612].

 *

 * Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by

 * presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't

 * need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.

 *

 * ==== Security Considerations

 *

 * There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature

 * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be

 * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have

 * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should

 * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be

 * generally recommended is:

 *

 * ```solidity

 * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {

 *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}

 *     doThing(..., value);

 * }

 *

 * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {

 *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);

 *     ...

 * }

 * ```

 *

 * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of

 * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also

 * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).

 *

 * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so

 * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.

 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.

 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just

 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.

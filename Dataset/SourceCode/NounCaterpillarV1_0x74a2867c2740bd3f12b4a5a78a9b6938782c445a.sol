// Contract by: @backseats_eth


// This is an experimental implementation of an allow list game for NounCats (NounCats.com / @NounCats on Twitter).
// Periodically, this contract will open up and anyone can add themselves to the allow list before we mint on February 14, 2022.

// DISCLAIMER: This costs gas to add yourself to the allow list via this method. Yes, there are better and gasless ways to run an allow list (like a Google Form, lol). 
// This is not our only way of taking addresses before mint. It's just a fun one.

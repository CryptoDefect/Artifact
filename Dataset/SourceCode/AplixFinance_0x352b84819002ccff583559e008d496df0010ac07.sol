1. Summary


With the craze for K-POP, Korea's representative content, the K-POP craze around the world is heating up  to the point that foreigners who want to learn Korean entertainment industry around the world are also  raging. This trend is expected to continue in the future, and the time for the Korean people to play a central role in the world is approaching. K-POP is now widely recognized as a genre of music that is popular  around the world, and the audition market that discovers K-POP singers and idols who are the main pillar  of this trend is becoming important. Through the singers discovered here, agencies also form a stable  business structure, release digital singles, expand them to the music market, appear members in various  TV programs to increase awareness, participate in events, and form a business structure through  commercials, movies, and dramas.

Audition programs to select the best winners by competing for large amounts of prize money or prize for  singing, dancing and various talents are gaining huge popularity in the country. A variety of programs are  available, including hip hop “Show Me the Money”, trot's “Miss Trot”, professional singers discovering their  new charms, "I Am a Singer" and "Immortal Songs”. Overseas, various audition programs such as pop idols,  “Got Talent”, and “Dancing With the Star” are gaining popularity. Audition programs play an important role  in the content market as stars born through this will quickly become million sellers and global stars through  proven skills that are basically determined by the public's choice.

However, despite this craze, viewers who did not feel new to auditions repeated in the same format or  ended early because the programs prepared by broadcasters with billions of won did not meet expectations. As a result, unless the audition program is also conducted in a large scale, the winners also  receive little attention and cannot continue the topic. In addition, unfair and biased judgments about screening in audition programs are also being pointed out as major problems in audition programs.

Accordingly, Shinlee Entertainment is planning to create a Aplix platform, utilize coins using the  blockchain called Aplix Finance to improve the shortcomings of the existing audition platform market, and  form a platform optimized for talent discovery through objective, transparent and fair evaluation. As a  fresh platform, we will proceed to provide fans with new directional content, fair challenge opportunities  for participants, and new talent discovery opportunities for planners, and improve existing shortcomings  and become the next generation audition platform.


2. Market Trend

Market trend in Audition 

K-POP, which is the core of the audition market, is clearly seen in the figures of the Korean pop culture industry  in the global market. Currently, it is estimated that nearly 200 million consumers enjoy K-POP, Korean movies, and dramas. The Korea Foundation announced last year that the number of members of Hallyu online clubs in  98 countries around the world alone reached 147.78 million. With the number of overseas markets increasing  more than three times in five years from 35.6 million in 2015, the size of overseas markets also doubled in four years from $5.7 billion in 2015, about 6.4 trillion won in Hanwha to $10 billion in 2019, and about 11 trillion won in Hanwha. K-POP albums are doing well alone despite the global record market recession. According to the IFPI International Record Industry Association, the global record market fell 5.7% annually from 2013 to 2019, but K-POP's record sales grew 28% annually.

Accordingly, the evaluation of the Korean pop culture industry is also rising vertically. Forbes, a renowned U.S. economic magazine, evaluated K-POP as a change in the way Western music fans view non-Western countries,  while Monocle, a British monthly magazine, reported that Korean music, movies, and dramas have become  Korea's strong soft power. The value of the Korean content industry is $59.8 billion as of 2018, accounting for  only 2.6% of the global market of $2.3 trillion. American entertainment media The Hollywood Reporter and  Monocle say Korea has set a new standard for innovation as a new force in the global entertainment market.

Experts analyzed that behind this trend, Korean digital revenue models, talent development systems, dramas,  movies, and games have a wide range of scalability, and the competitiveness of the K-culture industry is  recognized worldwide as a new innovative model. As soon as the song is released on the market, the audition market, which has an all-round ripple effect that spreads to Asia, South America, and Europe at the same time,  is rapidly growing. Through this, foreigners who want to learn Korean as a fan and join the flow of K-POP and tour Korea are busy, and audition programs are also emerging in Korea. The Song Ga-in craze, which recently  won through Miss Trot, is hitting the country to the point that it is called a syndrome even among middle-aged people, and this can be seen as an example of the recognition of the audition program.

The innovative competitiveness of the Korean pop culture industry, which the global entertainment industry is paying attention to, is a thoroughly digitized business model. In both K-POP, dramas, and movies, promotion  and fandom expansion through the Internet and social media are prioritized from the planning stage. A representative example of maximizing profits is that it faithfully follows various business models of the Internet industry, and 4K-class ultra-high definition music videos are also released on the Internet for free with the release of albums. Revenue per view is only 1 to 5 won, but if the number of viewers accumulates 100 million,about 400 million won is generated. In this way, Psy's Gangnam Style (4 billion views), which became the  cornerstone of global hits, is estimated to have earned a total of 16 billion won and BlACKPINK's Ddu-du Ddudu made about 6 billion won with 1.5 billion views. It is also a similar case for Korean dramas and movies to actively engage in online video OTT services such as Netflix, Wave, and TVing, which have far lower profits per view than TV broadcasts or movie theater releases.

The K-POP business model has expanded to Internet shopping malls that sell products for fans, real-time streaming online concerts that are growing as contact-free content develops due to recent pandemics, and community platform services for fans. This is seen as a faithful follow-up to the digital economy's Free-mium strategy, earning 95% free service and 5% loyal customers. Through this, Korea's digital content market was able to grow to the fifth largest in the world after the United States, China, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Variety, an American entertainment media outlet, said U.S. entertainment companies should refer to the competitiveness of the Korean pop culture industry, which is thoroughly combined with digital, and evaluated Korea as Silicon Valley of the entertainment industry.



Another innovative competitiveness of the Korean pop culture industry is globalism, or the trend of pursuing globalization. From human resources to recruiting foreign artists since the 2010s, global talent participation began in the audition market. In the direction of the audition, talented foreign talents participated in the audition program, including John Park, who finished second in Superstar K Season 2, and Bradley Ray Moor, who also finished second in season 3. On the artist side, major idol groups such as EXO, 2PM, Super Junior, TWICE, and BLACKPINK are representative. Not just stars, SM Entertainment has recruited foreign composers since 1998, and recently has managed more than 400 overseas composers, receiving hundreds of sample songs every month. Teddy, a key producer of YG Entertainment, another major entertainment company, is famous for being a Korean-American. As such, it has been revealed that most entertainment companies are thoroughly preparing to sell overseas copyrights from the pre-planning stage, such as trying to find codes that can be successful in the global market.



In the case of Superstar K mentioned above, expectations for the domestic audition platform were not high. The main reason is that it was still a genre unfamiliar to the public, and it was confirmed that the heat of Season 1, which produced stars such as Seo In-guk and Cho Moon-geun, gradually rose as the season passed. Despite the confrontation between John Park and Huh Gak on the cable channel, it drove the highest ratings to 18.1%, and to watch this, it was reported that viewers and fans watched all the intermediate advertisements. At the same time, it was an opportunity to establish the perception that cable channels were also worth watching. Since then, audition programs have been successful, producing stars such as Ulala Session, Roy Kim, and Kwak Jineon one after another, giving hope that anyone can become a star if they have skills regardless of appearance, origin, or background. You and I applied for the audition program, and millions of people participated in the real-time text voting.

Since then, through the "Produce 101 Series", the audition program will be popular once again with the merit that the public who are tired of the established idol group makes idols by focusing on the singer debut family, giving the public the role of judges, and encouraging participation. I.O.I, Wanna One, and IZWON, which were released through these projects, will become popular and popular without envy, and audition programs using experts who have steadily improved their skills in undergrounds unfamiliar to the public, such as Unpretty Rap Star, will also cause syndrome. The success factor is that 'completeness' is attracting attention, and it is evaluated that the stage of entertainers who have been practicing for many years or have been active since their debut has changed the flow according to the level of public eye that has increased the external charm that has been refined compared to the previous case of becoming an entertainer in the public.

Trot, which was the exclusive property of the middle-aged, has become a trend loved by the whole country with a big impact, and the recent audition program is no longer only aimed at the young. Not only did Miss Trot and Mr. Trot change the landscape of broadcasters, but thanks to the success of cable, terrestrial broadcasting, and both of us are appearing audition programs with the same theme. In the trot market, where outstanding performers and skills are important, singers without singing skills do not have a place to stand, and masterpieces armed with lyrics that touch the hearts of talented people captivate viewers. Like the steadily developing KPOP market, which has become a trend content by raising it as a new consumer class of the new generation, not just the middle-aged, the audition market is steadily developing, creating various winds of change..


3. Downsides in the audition market

However, there are still problems to be solved in the steadily developing K-POP market and audition market. With the success of the cable channel on cable broadcasting, the landscape of broadcasters has flocked to produce similar audition programs with the same content. In addition, other cable channels have begun producing audition programs for non-celebrities with similar textures, bringing only downward leveling due to excessive concentration. This can be attributed to the fact that the activities are significantly less than the previous winners as the season passes, and the public's interest, which has been tired of years of audition programs, has decreased. It is also drawing attention that talented talents run out of resources in the process of repeated seasons, making it difficult to find new faces.

There was also an incident that raised a profound problem with the fairness of the audition program. In an audition program that selects idols through viewers' choices, 29,978 votes, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 7th places appear in the same number, and all votes are repeated in the top 20 several times. As the allegations of vote manipulation turned out to be true, questions were raised about the fairness and transparency of the steadily developing audition program. The fact revealed here revealed that the production crew received tens of millions of won worth of entertainment agencies that featured trainees in exchange for manipulating the rankings. In addition, the operation was not only done in one season, but in almost every part from 1 to 4, and in the process of selecting about 20 people to reach the final round, the broadcasting industry was shocked to find out the situation in advance. Some participants were already aware of the elimination, and not only the production team's intervention, but also the victims of human rights violations through allegations of collusion by agencies. Through the touching human story, the biggest feature of the audition program, it destroyed the opportunity for participants and talents to communicate and lowered the credibility of the audition program. For the public, who are in despair because fair competition is inevitably different from the start, the audition program has spread to the worst situation that has devastated those who have worked hard and betrayed the hearts of fans who have supported it.

In addition, pursuing excessive commercialism of audition programs is also a problem, and there are opinions that it has been developed through the development of a program genre that can maximize the market’s value of "low cost, high ratings" and has a difficulty in concentrating on audition programs.


4. Aplix Finance Introduce

Aplix Finance's platform has steadily developed K-POP-based cultural business, so it has great growth potential, and participants have low thresholds and easy accessibility because the main stage is held online, not by broadcasters. To solve the problems of the existing audition market, Aplix Finance developed a noncounterfeit, source tracking, and transparent blockchain platform using distributed ledger technology (DLT), cryptography, etc. based on its own technology, field experience and experience of Shinlee Entertainment. Through this, we aim to establish a trust mechanism with an efficient, transparent, and steady development direction. The Aplix Finance network aims to give liquidity through competitive cryptocurrency projects and audition platforms for the next generation, which are different from existing audition programs.

4-1 Technology **

The Aplix Finance network is built on the basis of Ethereum, which aims to achieve fast, high performance at the level of a single node with decentralized and distributed blockchain systems.  Aplix Finance is a PBFT-like PoS blockchain, a web-scale decentralized network that supports more than 50,000TPS in a test-net environment.

Built with a focus on scalability, Aplix Finance can handle more transactions per second, making it more efficient and faster than current financial institutions. Aplix Finance, which is mainstream in the DeFi ecosystem and supports NFT, offers services similar to Ethereum, a base layer protocol, but differs from traditional Smart Contracts, and uses a hybrid blockchain architecture to create a fast, affordable and environmentally friendly execution environment.

Specifically, historical proof optimizes the network node communication method, meaning that the entire blockchain network implements single node-level performance and operates purely with computing power without bandwidth bottlenecks. Today's blockchain networks have a clock problem. The clock in the blockchain network flows every time a new blockchain is created, and Ethereum generates a block every 15 seconds, but the amount of information that can be put in the generated block is known to be quite limited. TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) for blockchain networks is a granular clock that takes less than two seconds for all valley data nodes to agree on, allowing more efficient handling of transactions. Aplix Finance's PoH refers to a time-unauthorized resource on the working network prior to agreement, not just an agreement protocol and anti-Sybil mechanism, but a solution for solving clock problems. Aplix Finance's valley data requires communication between valley data to agree that time has elapsed.VDF is not used for simple randomness, but each valley data utilizes VDF to maintain its own clock. Therefore, the selection of the leader of the valley data takes precedence over the overall epoch.

The epoch's schedule takes thousands of blocks, but unlike traditional tendermints, it does not wait for a failed node in the network, proving that each valley data runs VDF to secure slots for block and valley data transfer. Each block producer will take advantage of the structure in which the valley data will also be rewarded because they will receive compensation for block creation.

By utilizing PoH in Aplix Finance, the leader continues to change sequentially, and the entire network develops regardless of network conditions. This means that the network never goes down, and you can decide to replace the valley data without deciding between the network and the valley data. This is a mechanism that cannot be found in other blockchains and can be seen as a small but significant difference. This differs from the fact that communication should take place through these decisions in the existing blockchain and proceeds asynchronously. Aplix Finance's core technology has focused on securing designable space on the stack, providing timestamps-available clocks, as well as optimizing block time (800ms), block propagation (log200(n), throughput (50K-80-K TPS) and ledger storage (Petables) over the network through PoH.

Aplix Finance, which supports blockchain-based Dapps that provide DeFi and NFT services and is compatible with distributed autonomous organizations, is moving toward a steady development to provide steaking services in the future and build strong decentralized applications.

In addition, according to the future direction of the project, we plan to develop our own blockchain protocol, build our own Aplix Finance mainnet, and proceed with a blockchain project that develops as an audition platform for the next generation. In addition, technologies will be introduced to have scalability related to the cultural industry such as singers, music sources, videos, and children's songs by utilizing the characteristics of Shinlee Entertainment, which is conducting business. As a result, we would like to move toward continuous development with technology according to the steadily expanding business feasibility.


4-2 Architecture ***

+++++

4-3 Economy ***

Aplix Finance, organized by Aplix Finance, issues APX, a token that will be used in the ecosystem, to build an investment environment for rational blockchain projects, and enables voting, management, and donation using it. In addition, it is possible to manage tokens using Smart Contract, provide mining functions, and manage asset operations such as staking coins using Wallet. Contrary to concerns arising from existing audition programs, it is impossible to operate through blockchain, and aims to provide an objective and transparent audition voting platform through thorough verification. According to the development progress scale, we will proceed with our own mainnet, and we will provide an environment that can compensate ecosystem participants through steady development in terms of expansion of various contents and business size using Aplix Finance. Aplix Finance offers the following features:

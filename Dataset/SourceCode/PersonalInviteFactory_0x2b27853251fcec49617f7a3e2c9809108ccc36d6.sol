    The AllowList contract is used to manage a list of addresses and attest each address certain attributes.
    Examples for possible attributes are: is KYCed, is american, is of age, etc.
    One AllowList managed by one entity (e.g. tokenize.it) can manage up to 252 different attributes, and one tier with 5 levels, and can be used by an unlimited number of other Tokens.
*/
contract AllowList is Ownable2Step {
    /**
    @dev Attributes are defined as bit mask, with the bit position encoding it's meaning and the bit's value whether this attribute is attested or not. 
        Example:
        - position 0: 1 = has been KYCed (0 = not KYCed)
        - position 1: 1 = is american citizen (0 = not american citizen)
        - position 2: 1 = is a penguin (0 = not a penguin)
        These meanings are not defined within code, neither in the token contract nor the allowList. Nevertheless, the definition used by the people responsible for both contracts MUST match, 
        or the token contract will not work as expected. E.g. if the allowList defines position 2 as "is a penguin", while the token contract uses position 2 as "is a hedgehog", then the tokens 
        might be sold to hedgehogs, which was never the intention.
        Here some examples of how requirements can be used in practice:
        value 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000101, means "is KYCed and is a penguin"
        value 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000111, means "is KYCed, is american and is a penguin"
        value 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, means "has not proven any relevant attributes to the allowList operator" (default value)

        The highest four bits are defined as tiers as follows (depicted with less bits because 256 is a lot):
        - 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 0 
        - 0b0001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 1 
        - 0b0011000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 2 (and 1)
        - 0b0111000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 3 (and 2 and 1)
        - 0b1111000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 4 (and 3 and 2 and 1)
        This very simple definition allows for a maximum of 5 tiers, even though 4 bits are used for encoding. By sacrificing some space it can be implemented without code changes.

/**
@notice This contract represents the offer to buy an amount of tokens at a preset price. It is created for a specific buyer and can only be claimed once and only by that buyer.
    All parameters of the invitation (currencyPayer, tokenReceiver, currencyReceiver, tokenAmount, tokenPrice, currency, token) are immutable (see description of CREATE2).
    It is likely a company will create many PersonalInvites for specific investors to buy their one token.
    The use of CREATE2 (https://docs.openzeppelin.com/cli/2.8/deploying-with-create2) enables this invitation to be privacy preserving until it is accepted through 
    granting of an allowance to the PersonalInvite's future address and deployment of the PersonalInvite. 
@dev This contract is deployed using CREATE2 (https://docs.openzeppelin.com/cli/2.8/deploying-with-create2), using a deploy factory. That makes the future address of this contract 
    deterministic: it can be computed from the parameters of the invitation. This allows the company and buyer to grant allowances to the future address of this contract 
    before it is deployed.
    The process of deploying this contract is as follows:
    1. Company and investor agree on the terms of the invitation (currencyPayer, tokenReceiver, currencyReceiver, tokenAmount, tokenPrice, currency, token) 
        and a salt (used for deployment only).
    2. With the help of a deploy factory, the company computes the future address of the PersonalInvite contract.
    3. The company grants a token minting allowance of amount to the future address of the PersonalInvite contract.
    4. The investor grants a currency allowance of amount*tokenPrice / 10**tokenDecimals to the future address of the PersonalInvite contract, using their currencyPayer address.
    5. Finally, company, buyer or anyone else deploys the PersonalInvite contract using the deploy factory.
    Because all of the execution logic is in the constructor, the deployment of the PersonalInvite contract is the last step. During the deployment, the newly 
    minted tokens will be transferred to the buyer and the currency will be transferred to the company's receiver address.

    @notice  defines requirements to send or receive tokens for non-TRANSFERER_ROLE. If zero, everbody can transfer the token. If non-zero, then only those who have met the requirements can send or receive tokens. 
        Requirements can be defined by the REQUIREMENT_ROLE, and are validated against the allowList. They can include things like "must have a verified email address", "must have a verified phone number", "must have a verified identity", etc. 
        Also, tiers from 0 to four can be used.
    @dev Requirements are defined as bit mask, with the bit position encoding it's meaning and the bit's value whether this requirement will be enforced. 
        Example:
        - position 0: 1 = must be KYCed (0 = no KYC required)
        - position 1: 1 = must be american citizen (0 = american citizenship not required)
        - position 2: 1 = must be a penguin (0 = penguin status not required)
        These meanings are not defined within code, neither in the token contract nor the allowList. Nevertheless, the definition used by the people responsible for both contracts MUST match, 
        or the token contract will not work as expected. E.g. if the allowList defines position 2 as "is a penguin", while the token contract uses position 2 as "is a hedgehog", then the tokens 
        might be sold to hedgehogs, which was never the intention.
        Here some examples of how requirements can be used in practice:
        With requirements 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000101, only KYCed penguins will be allowed to send or receive tokens.
        With requirements 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000111, only KYCed american penguins will be allowed to send or receive tokens.
        With requirements 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, even french hedgehogs will be allowed to send or receive tokens.

        The highest four bits are defined as tiers as follows:
        - 0b0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 0 is required
        - 0b0001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 1 is required
        - 0b0010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 2 is required
        - 0b0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 3 is required
        - 0b1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 = tier 4 is required
        This very simple definition allows for a maximum of 5 tiers, even though 4 bits are used for encoding. By sacrificing some space it can be implemented without code changes.

        Keep in mind that addresses with the TRANSFERER_ROLE do not need to satisfy any requirements to send or receive tokens.

 * @dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access
 * control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role
 * members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some
 * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see
 * {AccessControlEnumerable}.
 *
 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed
 * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by
 * using `public constant` hash digests:
 *
 * ```
 * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256("MY_ROLE");
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a
 * function call, use {hasRole}:
 *
 * ```
 * function foo() public {
 *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));
 *     ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and
 * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only
 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.
 *
 * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means
 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
 * {_setRoleAdmin}.
 *
 * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to
 * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure
 * accounts that have been granted it.

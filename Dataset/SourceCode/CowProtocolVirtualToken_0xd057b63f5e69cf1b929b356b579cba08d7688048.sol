// The changes between the original contract and this are:
//  - the claim function doesn't trigger a transfer on a successful proof, but
//    it executes a dedicated (virtual) function.
//  - added a claimMany function for bundling multiple claims in a transaction
//  - supported sending an amount of native tokens along with the claim
//  - added the option of claiming less than the maximum amount
//  - gas optimizations in the packing and unpacking of the claimed bit
//  - bumped Solidity version

 * @title CollectionFactory
 * @author Omnisea @MaciejCzypek
 * @custom:version 1.0
 * @notice CollectionFactory is ERC721 collection creation service.
 *         Contract is responsible for validating and executing the function that creates ERC721 collection.
 *         Enables delegation of cross-chain collection creation via Omnichain Router which abstracts underlying cross-chain messaging.
 *         messaging protocols such as LayerZero and Axelar Network.
 *         With the TokenFactory contract, it is designed to avoid burn & mint mechanism to keep NFT's non-fungibility,
 *         on-chain history, and references to contracts. It supports cross-chain actions instead of ERC721 "transfer",
 *         and allows simultaneous actions from many chains, without requiring the NFT presence on the same chain as
 *         the user performing the action (e.g. mint).

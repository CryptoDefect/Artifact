/**
 * @dev EtherSwap is a contract for swapping Ether across chains.
 *
 *
 * This contract should be deployed on the chains you want to swap Ether on.
 *
 *
 * How does a swap work?
 *
 * A user would announce his intention to swap Ether on a chain by calling the
 * contract's overloaded {commit} function with:
 *  - `msg.value` equal to the contract's `fee` + `_payout`
 *  - `_expectedAmount` the expected amount of ether to receive on the target
 *     chain
 *  - `_lockTimeSec` the duration the swap offer is valid
 *  - `_secretHash` the hash of the secret that will be revealed to claim the
 *    swap
 *  - `_payout` the amount of ether to be paid to the counterparty claiming the
 *    swap
 *  - `_recipient` either set to the ZERO_ADDRESS (if counterparty is unknown) or
 *    to the address of the counterparty
 *
 * A counterparty that wants to match this trade would first have to check
 * whether the duration of the offer is enough for him to complete the swap.
 * If so, he would call the {changeRecipient} function to designate himself as
 * the recipient of the funds locked for this trade.
 *
 * Then he would call the {commit} function on the target chain with:
 *  - `msg.sender` set to the same address that was used in `changeRecipient`
 *  - `_recipient` set to the user who created the swap on the source chain
 *  - `_expectedAmount` expected amount of ether to receive should be set to the
 *    amount of ether locked in source chain swap
 *  - `_swapEndTimestamp` the duration should be set to a value lower than the
 *    source swap's endTimeStamp (if source endTimeStamp is bigger than
 *    recipientChangeLockDuration, the endTimestamp should be set to a value
 *    lower than recipientChangeLockDuration)
 *  - `_hashedSecret` should be set to the same value as the source swap's
 *    `_hashedSecret`.
 *
 * Once the target swap is created, the user who created the source swap would
 * make sure that the target swap is created with the expected params and then
 * call the {claim} function on the target chain with the secret that was used
 * to create the source swap. If the secret is correct the user would  receive
 * the amount of ether locked on the target chain.
 *
 * Now the counterparty knows the secret and can call the `claim` function on
 * the source chain with it. This call should happen within the endTimestamp
 * of the source swap. If that is the case the counterparty would receive the
 * amount of ether locked on the source chain. If the counterparty calls the
 * {claim} function after the endTimestamp of the source swap has passed he
 * won't receive any funds.
 *
 * ATTENTION: A counterparty matching a swap should make sure to have enough
 * time to submit the proof once it is being revealed by the user. Failure to
 * submit the {claim} transaction in time would result in the counterparty not
 * receiving any funds on the source chain.
 *
 * How does a refund work?
 *
 * If a swap didn't occur, once the endTimestamp of the swap has passed, the
 * parties can call the {refund} function to receive their funds back.
 *
 * Fees
 *
 * The contract can be deployed with a _feePerMillion value. This value would
 * indicate the amount of ETH that would be taken from the amount of ETH locked.
 *
 * The accrued fees can be sent to the _feeRecipient address by calling the
 * {withdrawFees} function.

    In consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

    1. LICENSES & RESTRICTIONS.
        1.1 NFT. These “NFTs” are defined as non-fungible tokens.
        Ownership of which this specific collection is registered on the ethereum blockchain as;
            Name: “The ApeFathers NFT” (the “Business”) - the NFT "project" operations, employees, agents, representatives and subcontractors,
            Token Tracker: “DAPES” (the “Token”) - the tracker ID for the Digital Assets on the ethereum blockchain,
            Smart-Contract: “ApeFathers.sol” (the “NFT Smart-Contract”) - this specific instance of the ApeFathers.sol smart contract deployed on the ethereum blockchain,
            Artist: "Tahliazr" (the "Artist") - designed and created the traits conceptualized by GSKNNFT Inc., and furthermore signed the contract ("NFT Licensing Agreement") to transfer the Licenses of the traits created by their ("The Artist's") own hand,
            Artist Contract: ("NFT Licensing Agreement") - Contract for the transfer of original Intellectual Property of the individual trait images created by The Artist and formally signed by both parties (The Artist and GSKNNFT Inc.),
            Created by: (“Licensor”) - Gordon Skinner of GSKNNFT Inc. ("@GSKNNFT", "gsknnft.eth", "[email protected]").

        For the case of this NFT Owner Agreement; any NFT within The ApeFathers NFT collection sold or otherwise transferred to Owner pursuant to this Agreement shall be a “Digital Asset.”
        The Digital Asset(s) are associated with digital objects (which may include images and/or other digital works) (“Digital Object(s)”).
        A copy of this contract can be found linked to the Digital Asset, available for Owner's review at any time, and enforceable unless voided by its terms.
        The Licensor guarantees that the IP for the Digital Objects created for The ApeFathers NFT collection has been agreed upon, signed in a separate contract ("NFT Licensing Agreement"), and is owned and paid in full by GSKNNFT Inc. This includes;    The IP Agreement formally signed by both parties ("The Artist") and Licensor, who created the traits for compiling the Digital Object(s) through random generation.
        A copy of the Artist Contract can be found on the Official The ApeFathers NFT website, which can be referenced and reviewed by Owner and Licensor for review at any time; and enforceable unless voided by the terms of either Agreement mentioned (.
        As detailed below, the Owner may own a Digital Asset, with a full commercial IP license to the Digital Object(s) subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.
        Purchase of the ApeFathers NFT (the “Main Asset”) may entitle the purchaser to be declared the Owner, and to utilize their specific held asset(s) for their own personal use of the Intellectual Property (“IP”) of ONLY the associated media tied to the Digital Asset on the blockchain.
        For the avoidance of doubt, the term “Digital Asset(s),” as used herein, includes both the Main Asset and any Digital Objects directly associated with the Main Asset.

    1.2. Digital Asset(s).
        The Digital Asset(s) are subject to copyright and other intellectual property protections, which rights are and shall remain owned by solely the Owner of the individual NFT(s).

    1.3. Licenses.
        Main Asset.
            Upon a valid transfer of Main Asset to Owner, Licensor hereby grants Owner a limited, transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty free license to use, publish and display the Digital Object(s) associated with the Main Asset during the Term, subject to Owner’s compliance with the terms and conditions set forth herein, including without limitation, any restrictions in Section 1.4 below, solely for the following purposes: 
                (a) for their own personal, or commercial use; or 
                (ii) to display the Main Asset for resale.
        Upon expiration of the Term or breach of any conditions of this Owner Agreement by Owner, all license rights shall immediately terminate.

    1.4. License Restrictions.
        The Digital Asset(s) provided pursuant to this Owner Agreement are licensed, not sold, and Owner receives title to or ownership of the Digital Asset(s) or the intellectual property rights therein.
        Except for the license expressly set forth herein, no other rights (express or implied) to the Digital Assets(s) are granted. Licensor reserves all rights not expressly granted.
        Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Licensor grants the Owner a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the full Commercial IP solely for the purpose of utilizing the Main Asset and any associated Digital Objects held by the Owner on the blockchain.
        Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Owner shall have the license through this agreement to: 
            (a) copy, modify, or distribute the Digital Asset(s);
            (b) use the Digital Asset(s) to advertise, market or sell a product and/or service;
            (c) incorporate the Digital Asset(s) in videos or other media; or
            (d) sell merchandise incorporating the Digital Asset(s).
        Upon a permitted transfer of ownership of the Digital Asset(s) by Owner to a third party, the license to the Digital Assets(s) associated therewith shall be transferable solely subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, including those in Section 6.3, and the Owner’s license to such Digital Assets(s) terminates immediately upon transfer to such third party.
        Upon transfer of the NFT to a new owner, all ownership and rights to the underlying IP associated with the NFT are also transferred to the new owner, and for the sake of this agreement, the transfer date will be considered the "Effective Date" of the individual, now representative as the "Owner", and subject to any limitations or restrictions explicitly stated in this agreement.
        Upon a non-permitted transfer of ownership of the Digital Asset(s) by Owner to a third party, the Owner’s license to the Digital Assets(s) associated therewith terminates immediately, and any purported transfer of the license to such Digital Assets(s) to such third party shall be void.
         Owner shall not, and shall not permit any third party to, do any of the following:
            (a) Use the Digital Asset in connection with any illegal activity or for any unlawful purpose;
            (b) use or publish any modification of the Digital Asset(s) in any way that would be immoral or goes against the standards of practice set out by “The ApeFathers NFT”, and/or GSKNNFT Inc, including without limitation, any link or other reference to license information.
            (c) Use the Digital Asset in a manner that infringes the rights of any third party, including but not limited to intellectual property rights;
            (d) Remove or alter any trademark, logo, copyright, other legal notices or proprietary notices, metadata legends, symbols, or labels associated with, in or on the Digital Asset(s) or Digital Object(s);
            (e) Transfer the Digital Asset in violation of any applicable law, including without limitation the securities laws of any jurisdiction;
            (f) Use the Digital Asset to compete with Licensor or the Business in any way.
        Failure to comply with the conditions set forth in Sections 1.3 and 1.4 constitutes a material breach.

    2. IP Rights in the Digital Asset.
        2.1. Ownership.
            All rights, title, and interest in and to the Digital Object(s), including all intellectual property rights therein, are and shall remain the exclusive property of the Licensor and its licensors, as applicable. Owner's rights to use the Digital Object(s) are limited to those expressly granted in this Owner Agreement. No other rights with respect to the Digital Object(s) or any related intellectual property rights are implied.
        2.2. Reservation of Rights.
            Except for the limited rights and licenses expressly granted under this Owner Agreement, nothing in this Owner Agreement grants, by implication, waiver, estoppel, or otherwise, to Owner or any third party any intellectual property rights or other right, title, or interest in or to the Digital Object(s) or any other content owned or licensed by the Licensor.
            The Owner shall not, and shall not permit the use of a third party to reproduce, distribute, display, or create derivative works based on the IP without the prior written consent of the Owner.
            All Intellectual Property rights of the material stated in this contract belong to the Owner, subject to the terms and conditions, except where otherwise stated or provided by the Licensor ("GSKNNFT Inc.").
            These rights will remain valid as explicitly stated herein, including; through any future Owner-invoked evolutions (changes as per the Owner's own decision with the proof of such logged as a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain), specifically and exclusively offered by the Licensor ("GSKNNFT Inc.") through any mechanism, platform, tool, or method used.

    3. Replica(s).
        The owner understands and agrees that the Licensor has no control over, and shall have no liability for, any Replicas.
        Owner understands and agrees that Platforms and/or Replica(s) may become unavailable or cease to exist at any time.

    4. Specific Disclaimer.
        LICENSOR MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF NONINFRINGEMENT.
        OWNER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE DIGITAL ASSET IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
        Owner agrees not to use the Permissable Work, Digital Asset(s) or Digital Object(s) to commit any criminal offense, nor to distribute any malicious, harmful, offensive or obscene material.
        Owner understands and accepts the risks of blockchain technology.
        Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensor does not warrant that the Digital Asset(s) will perform without error.
        Further, Licensor provides no warranty regarding, and will have no responsibility for, any claim arising out of:
            (i) a modification of the Digital Asset(s) made by anyone other than Licensor and/or Owner, unless Licensor or Owner approves such modification in writing;
            (ii) Owner’s misuse of or misrepresentation regarding the Digital Asset(s); or 
            (iii) any technology, including without limitation, any Replica or Platform, that fails to perform or ceases to exist.
        Licensor shall not be obligated to provide any support to Owner or any subsequent owner of the Digital Asset(s).

    5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; INDEMNITY.
        5.1. Dollar Cap.
            LICENSOR’S CUMULATIVE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS OWNER AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OWNER(S) PAID THE LICENSOR FOR DIGITAL ASSET(S).
        5.2. Excluded Damages. 
            THE LICENSOR AND ITS AFFILIATES WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES SUCH AS LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF REVENUE, OR ANY OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES.
        5.3. Clarifications & Disclaimers.
        This section contains important information about the limitations of liability. It is broken down into smaller subsections for ease of reading.
            The language has been simplified and made more accessible to non-legal professionals.
            The liabilities limited by this section apply:
                (a) to liability for negligence;
                (b) no matter what legal action is taken;
                (c) even if the owner is advised in advance of the possibility of the damages in question and even if such damages were foreseeable; and
                (d) even if licensor's remedies fail of their essential purpose.
            If applicable law limits the application of the provisions of this section, licensor’s liability will be limited to the maximum extent permissible.
            LICENSOR DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE DIGITAL ASSET WILL BE SECURE, UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR THAT ANY DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED.
            OWNER ASSUMES ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF THE DIGITAL ASSET.

            For the avoidance of doubt, Licensor’s liability limits and other rights set forth in this section apply likewise to Licensor’s affiliates, licensors, suppliers, advertisers, agents, sponsors, directors, officers, employees, consultants, and other representatives.
           
        5.4. Indemnity.
            Owner will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Licensors and its affiliates, and any of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, contractors, and agents (“Licensor Indemnitees”) from and against any and all claims, causes of action, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and legal costs, which shall be reimbursed as incurred) arising out of, related to, or alleging Owner’s breach of any provision in this agreement, including but not limited to Owner’s failure to comply with the licensing conditions set forth in Section 1.

    6. Term & Termination.
        6.1. Term.
            This Owner Agreement shall continue until terminated pursuant to Subsection 6.2 or 6.3 below (the “Term”).
        6.2. Termination for Transfer.
            The license granted in Section 1 only applies to the extent that the owner continues to possess the Digital Asset.
            If the owner transfers partial ownership of the Digital Asset(s) through fractionalized ownership, the owner with the majority fractionalized portion of the Digital Asset(s) retains the Intellectual Property and any rights and limitations as stated by this agreement shall be considered valid and in force.
            If at any time the Owner sells, trades, donates, gives away, transfers, or otherwise disposes of a Digital Asset for any reason, this Owner Agreement, including without limitation, the license rights granted to Owner in Section 1 will immediately terminate, with respect to such Digital Asset, without the requirement of notice, and Owner will have no further rights in or to such Digital Asset or Digital Object(s) associated therewith.
        6.3. Termination for Cause.
            Licensor may terminate this Owner Agreement for Owner’s material breach by written notice specifying in detail the nature of the breach, effective in thirty (30) days unless the Owner first cures such breach, or effective immediately if the breach is not subject to cure.
        6.4. Effects of Termination.
            Upon termination of this Owner Agreement, Owner shall cease all use of the Digital Object(s) and delete, destroy, or return all copies of the Digital Object(s) in its possession or control.
            In the event of termination, any amounts paid by the Owner to the Licensor for the Digital Asset(s) shall be deemed earned and non-refundable.
            Owner shall not be entitled to any refund or compensation in connection with the termination of this Owner Agreement.
        6.4. Effects of Termination.
            Upon termination of this Owner Agreement, Owner shall cease all use of the Digital Object(s) and delete, destroy, or return all copies of the Digital Object(s) in its possession or control.
            Any provision of this Owner Agreement that must survive to fulfill its essential purpose will survive termination or expiration.

    7. MISCELLANEOUS.
        7.1. Independent Contractors.
            The parties are independent contractors and shall so represent themselves in all regards.
            Neither party is the agent of the other, and neither may make commitments on the other’s behalf.
        7.2. Force Majeure.
            No delay, failure, or default, other than a failure to pay fees when due, will constitute a breach of this Owner Agreement to the extent caused by acts of;
                war, terrorism, hurricanes, earthquakes, epidemics, other acts of God or of nature, strikes or other labor disputes, riots or other acts of civil disorder, embargoes, government orders responding to any of the foregoing, or other causes beyond the performing party’s reasonable control.
        7.3. Counterparts.
             This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
        7.4. Assignment & Successors. 
            Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth herein, including in Sections 1.4 and this Section 6.3, Owner may transfer ownership of the Digital Asset(s) to a third-party, provided that Owner:
                (i) has not breached this Owner Agreement prior to the transfer;
                (ii) notifies such third party that Licensor shall receive a royalty equal of up to 15% of the purchase price for any sale of a Digital Asset by such third-party; and
                (iii) Owner ensures that such third party is made aware of this Owner Agreement and agrees to be bound by the obligations and restrictions set forth herein.
            If the third party does not agree to be bound by the obligations and restrictions set forth herein, then the licenses granted herein shall terminate.
            In no case shall any of the license rights or other rights granted herein be transferrable apart from the transfer of ownership of the entire Digital Asset, proof of which will be logged on the ethereum blockchain.
            Except to the extent forbidden in this Owner Agreement, this agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties’ respective successors and assigns.
            Any purported assignment or transfer in violation of Section 7.4 herein, including the transfer restriction in Section 1.4, shall be void.
            Only a single entity may own each entire Digital Asset at any time, with the exclusion of fractionalization ownership, and only the entities previously named shall have a license to the Digital Object(s) associated therewith.
            Owner may fractionalize the use of Digital Asset, but ownership is never forfeited:        
                In the case of fractionalized ownership, the owner with the majority fractionalized portion of the Digital Asset(s) retains the Intellectual Property and any rights and limitations as stated by this agreement shall be considered valid and in force.
                While multiple Owners may consider themselves holders of the NFT through fractionalization, as per this agreement, the full commercial IP rights remain with the majority holder of the fractionalized Digital Asset.
                No claim shall be made by any fractionalized NFT Owner towards the Licensor (GSKNNFT Inc.) or it's affiliates or associates with regards to IP ownership and member benefits of The ApeFathers NFT brand.
                Upon retaining a fractionalized minority of the Digital Asset(s), the fractionalized owner will be considered excluded, as not the majority holder, from any and all terms and conditions set forth within this Owner Agreement.
            Upon transfer of a Digital Asset from a first Owner to a second Owner, the license to the first owner for the Digital Object(s) associated with such Digital Asset shall immediately terminate.
        7.5. Severability.
            To the extent permitted by applicable law, the parties hereby waive any provision of law that would render any clause of this Owner Agreement invalid or otherwise unenforceable in any respect.
            In the event that a provision of this Owner Agreement is held to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, such provision will be interpreted to fulfill its intended purpose to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and the remaining provisions of this Owner Agreement will continue in full force and effect.
        7.6. No Waiver.
            Neither party will be deemed to have waived any of its rights under this Owner Agreement by lapse of time or by any statement or representation other than by an authorized representative in an explicit written waiver.
            No waiver of a breach of this Owner Agreement will constitute a waiver of any other breach of this Owner Agreement.
        7.7. Choice of Law & Jurisdiction:
            This Owner Agreement is governed by Canadian law, or any Federal, Provincial, Territorial, or State law where the Licensor (GSKNNFT INC.) is located and conducts their business in the future, and both parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Provincial and Federal courts located in Canada or any federal jurisdiction as per the location of the Licensor, and waive any right to challenge personal jurisdiction or venue.
        7.8. Entire Agreement.
            This Owner Agreement sets forth the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous writings, negotiations, and discussions with respect to its subject matter, exclusive of the NFT Licensing Agreement as stated herewithin..
            Neither party has relied upon any such prior or contemporaneous communications, exclusive of the NFT Licensing Agreement as stated herewithin.
        7.9. Amendment.
            This Owner Agreement may not be amended in any way except through a written agreement by authorized representatives of the Licensor and the current owner of the Digital Asset(s).

/**

 * @title PaymentSplitter

 * @dev This contract allows to split Ether payments among a group of accounts. The sender does not need to be aware

 * that the Ether will be split in this way, since it is handled transparently by the contract.

 *

 * The split can be in equal parts or in any other arbitrary proportion. The way this is specified is by assigning each

 * account to a number of shares. Of all the Ether that this contract receives, each account will then be able to claim

 * an amount proportional to the percentage of total shares they were assigned.

 *

 * `PaymentSplitter` follows a _pull payment_ model. This means that payments are not automatically forwarded to the

 * accounts but kept in this contract, and the actual transfer is triggered as a separate step by calling the {release}

 * function.

 *

 * NOTE: This contract assumes that ERC20 tokens will behave similarly to native tokens (Ether). Rebasing tokens, and

 * tokens that apply fees during transfers, are likely to not be supported as expected. If in doubt, we encourage you

 * to run tests before sending real value to this contract.

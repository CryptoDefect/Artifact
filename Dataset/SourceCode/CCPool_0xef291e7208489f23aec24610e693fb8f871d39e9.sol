/**

 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed

 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an

 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer

 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.

 *

 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be

 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in

 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.

 *

 * For example:

 *

 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]

 * ```solidity

 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {

 *     function initialize() initializer public {

 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");

 *     }

 * }

 *

 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {

 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {

 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");

 *     }

 * }

 * ```

 *

 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as

 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.

 *

 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure

 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.

 *

 * [CAUTION]

 * ====

 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.

 *

 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation

 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke

 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:

 *

 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]

 * ```

 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor

 * constructor() {

 *     _disableInitializers();

 * }

 * ```

/**

 * @dev Interface of the ERC20 Permit extension allowing approvals to be made via signatures, as defined in

 * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612[EIP-2612].

 *

 * Adds the {permit} method, which can be used to change an account's ERC20 allowance (see {IERC20-allowance}) by

 * presenting a message signed by the account. By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't

 * need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.

 *

 * ==== Security Considerations

 *

 * There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature

 * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be

 * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have

 * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should

 * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be

 * generally recommended is:

 *

 * ```solidity

 * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {

 *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}

 *     doThing(..., value);

 * }

 *

 * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {

 *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);

 *     ...

 * }

 * ```

 *

 * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of

 * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also

 * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).

 *

 * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so

 * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.

 *

 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide

 * https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How

 * to implement supply mechanisms].

 *

 * The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override

 * this function so it returns a different value.

 *

 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert

 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless

 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20

 * applications.

 *

 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.

 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just

 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit

 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.

 *

 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}

 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting

 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

/**

 * @dev https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712[EIP 712] is a standard for hashing and signing of typed structured data.

 *

 * The encoding specified in the EIP is very generic, and such a generic implementation in Solidity is not feasible,

 * thus this contract does not implement the encoding itself. Protocols need to implement the type-specific encoding

 * they need in their contracts using a combination of `abi.encode` and `keccak256`.

 *

 * This contract implements the EIP 712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding

 * scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA

 * ({_hashTypedDataV4}).

 *

 * The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating

 * the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain.

 *

 * NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as "v4", as implemented by the JSON RPC method

 * https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask].

 *

 * NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain

 * separator of the implementation contract. This will cause the `_domainSeparatorV4` function to always rebuild the

 * separator from the immutable values, which is cheaper than accessing a cached version in cold storage.

 *

 * _Available since v3.4._

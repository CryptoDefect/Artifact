 * @title V2ToV3Rollover
 * @author Non-Fungible Technologies, Inc.
 *
 * This contract is used to rollover a loan from the legacy V2 lending protocol to the new
 * V3 lending protocol. The rollover mechanism takes out a flash loan for the principal +
 * interest of the old loan from Balancer pool, repays the V2 loan, and starts a new loan on V3.
 * This migration contract can only used with specific loan terms signed by a lender not from a
 * collection wide offer. To perform a rollover with items, use V2ToV3RolloverWithItems contract.
 *
 * It is required that the V2 protocol has zero fees enabled. This contract only works with
 * ERC721 collateral.

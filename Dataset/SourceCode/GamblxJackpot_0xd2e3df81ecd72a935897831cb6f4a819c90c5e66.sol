 * GAMBLX JACKPOT CONTRACT

 *

 * Unlike traditional casinos with a house edge, at GAMBLX, our unique game mechanics system eliminates the house edge. This means (f.e.) you can enjoy up to an 80% chance to win X2 bets, depending on the round. Imagine the possibilities - with a total pool of $2800, a mere $40 bet can grant you a 50% chance to win, particularly during rounds with high bonus pools and smaller bets. Say goodbye to always losing â€“ at GAMBLX, you have the advantage!

 * 50% of token volume tax funds are automatically added to jackpot rounds as bonus pools.

 * Additionally, 30% of total casino revenue is shared randomly into game pools, and 10% of casino revenue is used for token buyback at random interval.

 * The token is deflationary, with 5% of tokens from tax volume being burned automatically.

 * Holders of the token become part owners of the casino, receiving 30% of casino revenue and 20% of token tax fees through the Revenue Share Program.

 * Return to Player (RTP) can reach up to +1000%, depending on the round and bonus pool. Players can even apply their skills to calculate the best timing to join game.

 * Fully decentralized, winners for each round are automatically chosen using our smart contract provable fair system.

 * 10% of each game pool contributes to casino revenue, and 30% of this revenue is shared with token holders through the Revenue Share system.

 *

 *

 * At GamblX, we believe in provably fair gaming. Every game, bet, and winner can be verified, as our smart contract automatically selects winners at the end of each game, leaving no room for human intervention.

 * As we expand our offerings, players can expect a diverse range of games designed to cater to all interests and preferences. From classic casino games with a blockchain twist to groundbreaking and unique creations, each game promises a seamless and transparent gaming experience.

 * Our new games will feature provably fair mechanics, ensuring that players can verify the fairness of every outcome independently. The blockchain's decentralized nature provides added security and trust, ensuring that the integrity of the games remains uncompromised.

 * Whether you are a seasoned gambler or a newcomer to the world of blockchain gaming, our upcoming releases will captivate and entertain you. Prepare to embark on an unforgettable journey, where thrilling gameplay and blockchain technology converge to create an unparalleled gaming adventure.

 * GamblX invites players to join our revolution in the gambling world, where trust, fairness, and exhilarating gaming experiences converge. Embrace the advantage and explore the endless possibilities of winning with GamblX.

     * false is an externally-owned account (EOA) and not a contract.

     *

     * Among others, `isContract` will return false for the following

     *  - a contract in construction

     *  - an address where a contract will be created

     *  - an address where a contract lived, but was destroyed

     *

     * Furthermore, `isContract` will also return true if the target contract within

     * the same transaction is already scheduled for destruction by `SELFDESTRUCT`,

     * which only has an effect at the end of a transaction.

     * ====

     *

     * [IMPORTANT]

     * ====

     * You shouldn't rely on `isContract` to protect against flash loan attacks!

     *

     * Preventing calls from contracts is highly discouraged. It breaks composability, breaks support for smart wallets

     * like Gnosis Safe, and does not provide security since it can be circumvented by calling from a contract

     * constructor.

  @title ERC20GuildUpgradeable

  @dev Extends an ERC20 functionality into a Guild, adding a simple governance system over an ERC20 token.
  An ERC20Guild is a simple organization that execute arbitrary calls if a minimum amount of votes is reached in a 
  proposal option while the proposal is active.
  The token used for voting needs to be locked for a minimum period of time in order to be used as voting power.
  Every time tokens are locked the timestamp of the lock is updated and increased the lock time seconds.
  Once the lock time passed the voter can withdraw his tokens.
  Each proposal has options, the voter can vote only once per proposal and cant change the chosen option, only
  increase the voting power of his vote.
  A proposal ends when the minimum amount of total voting power is reached on a proposal option before the proposal
  finish.
  When a proposal ends successfully it executes the calls of the winning option.
  The winning option has a certain amount of time to be executed successfully if that time passes and the option didn't
  executed successfully, it is marked as failed.
  The guild can execute only allowed functions, if a function is not allowed it will need to set the allowance for it.
  The allowed functions have a timestamp that marks from what time the function can be executed.
  A limit to a maximum amount of active proposals can be set, an active proposal is a proposal that is in Active state.
  Gas can be refunded to the account executing the vote, for this to happen the voteGas and maxGasPrice values need to
  be set.
  Signed votes can be executed in behalf of other users, to sign a vote the voter needs to hash it with the function
  hashVote, after signing the hash teh voter can share it to other account to be executed.
  Multiple votes and signed votes can be executed in one transaction.

  @title BaseERC20Guild
  @author github:AugustoL
  @dev Extends an ERC20 functionality into a Guild, adding a simple governance system over an ERC20 token.
  An ERC20Guild is a simple organization that execute arbitrary calls if a minimum amount of votes is reached in a 
  proposal option while the proposal is active.
  The token used for voting needs to be locked for a minimum period of time in order to be used as voting power.
  Every time tokens are locked the timestamp of the lock is updated and increased the lock time seconds.
  Once the lock time passed the voter can withdraw his tokens.
  Each proposal has options, the voter can vote only once per proposal and cannot change the chosen option, only
  increase the voting power of his vote.
  A proposal ends when the minimum amount of total voting power is reached on a proposal option before the proposal
  finish.
  When a proposal ends successfully it executes the calls of the winning option.
  The winning option has a certain amount of time to be executed successfully if that time passes and the option didn't
  executed successfully, it is marked as failed.
  The guild can execute only allowed functions, if a function is not allowed it will need to set the allowance for it.
  The allowed functions have a timestamp that marks from what time the function can be executed.
  A limit to a maximum amount of active proposals can be set, an active proposal is a proposal that is in Active state.
  Gas can be refunded to the account executing the vote, for this to happen the voteGas and maxGasPrice values need to
  be set.
  Signed votes can be executed in behalf of other users, to sign a vote the voter needs to hash it with the function
  hashVote, after signing the hash teh voter can share it to other account to be executed.
  Multiple votes and signed votes can be executed in one transaction.
  The guild can sign EIP1271 messages, to do this the guild needs to call itself and allow the signature to be verified 
  with and extra signature of any account with voting power.

/**
 * @dev This contract extends an ERC20 token with a snapshot mechanism. When a snapshot is created, the balances and
 * total supply at the time are recorded for later access.
 *
 * This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.
 * In naive implementations it's possible to perform a "double spend" attack by reusing the same balance from different
 * accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be
 * used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.
 *
 * Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a
 * snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot
 * id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id
 * and the account address.
 *
 * NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it
 * return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the begining of each new block. When overridding this
 * function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.
 *
 * Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient
 * alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.
 *
 * ==== Gas Costs
 *
 * Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log
 * n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much
 * smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.
 *
 * There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is
 * only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent
 * transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.

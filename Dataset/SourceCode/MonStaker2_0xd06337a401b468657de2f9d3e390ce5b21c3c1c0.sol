/**

 * @dev Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access

 * control mechanisms.

 *

 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed

 * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by

 * using `public constant` hash digests:

 *

 * ```

 * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256("MY_ROLE");

 * ```

 *

 * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a

 * function call, use {hasRole}:

 *

 * ```

 * function foo() public {

 *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));

 *     ...

 * }

 * ```

 *

 * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and

 * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only

 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.

 *

 * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means

 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other

 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using

 * {_setRoleAdmin}.

 *

 * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to

 * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure

 * accounts that have been granted it.

# Artifacts

This repository contains the artifacts for the paper "When Crypto Fails: Demystifying Cryptographic Defects in Ethereum Smart Contracts".

It includes the source code of CryptoScan, datasets collected for analysis and experiment, and the results of the experiments.

Specifically, it includes the following content:

* [`./CryptoScan/`](https://github.com/CryptoDefect/Artifact/tree/main/CryptoScan): the source code of CryptoScan, a static analyzer designed to detect cryptographic defects in Ethereum smart contracts before deployment.  Please refer to [`./CryptoScan/README.md`](https://github.com/CryptoDefect/Artifact/tree/main/CryptoScan#readme) for detailed instructions on installation and usage.
* [`./Dataset/`](https://github.com/CryptoDefect/Artifact/tree/main/Dataset): dataset collected for analysis and experiment. Please refer to [`./Dataset/README.md`](https://github.com/CryptoDefect/Artifact/tree/main/Dataset#readme)  for detailed information.
* [`./Experiments/`](https://github.com/CryptoDefect/Artifact/tree/main/Experiments): the results of the experiments. For detailed information on the results and instructions to replicate the experiments, please see the  [`./Experiments/README.md`](https://github.com/CryptoDefect/Artifact/tree/main/Experiments#readme) file.

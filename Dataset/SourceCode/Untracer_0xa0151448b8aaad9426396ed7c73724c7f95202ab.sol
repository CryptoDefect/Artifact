 * INTRODUCTION:
 *      Untracer is a Token Mixer that runs 100% on the Ethereum and Binance Smart
 *      Chain blockchains. It consists of a contract that manages and securely
 *      stores deposits and withdrawals verified with a security token, which is 
 *      the first true implementation of a 2FA system in a decentralized environment.
 * 
 *      To execute the mixing, which makes the transaction history of funds in 
 *      wallets untraceable, only a few simple and fast steps are required. There
 *      is no web dApp interface for the protocol to avoid possible censorship of
 *      the system.
 * 
 *      The Untracer interface can be accessed through Etherscan for contract on the  
 *      Ethereum Network or through Bscscan for the contract on the Binance Smart Chain. 
 *
 *      The contract can be accessed from its official ethereum URL: untracer.eth
 *
 *      There are two phases to execute the mixing. Deposit, with password and  
 *      2FA code; and Withdrawal, with the password and the 2FA code.
 *
 * GUIDE:
 *  Step 1: 
 *      Go to the READ CONTRACT section of the page.
 *
 *      Choose a password of at least 18 characters, can be letters, numbers and 
 *      symbols. The more complicated it is, the more secure the transfer is. Make
 *      sure you save or write the password somewhere safe!
 * 
 *      Once the password is inserted, generate a hash code of the password with the 
 *      QUERY button. The system returns a hash code of the password (0xf4...). 
 *      Copy it and move to the WRITE CONTRACT section of the page. 
 * 
 *  Step 2:
 *      Connect the wallet to etherscan from which funds will be sent from, select 
 *      deposit amount which can be (0.1, 0.5, 1, 5), enter this amount in the DEPOSIT 
 *      section, using dot as the decimal separator, below add the previously generated
 *      hash code, then at CODE a number of choice from 1 to 99 as the 2FA number. 
 * 
 *      This verification number and the password will be the key to obtaining the 
 *      funds after mixing. After pressing the WRITE button, the wallet will open and
 *      require confirmation. Once confirmed, the funds will be moved to the contract. 
 *      The deposit is now completed!
 *
 *  Step 3:
 *      After some time (the longer the wait, the more private it is) refresh and 
 *      re-connect to the same page as before with a new, unused wallet. 
 *
 *      First, confirm the 2FA code number that was chosen during the deposit phase. 
 *      Enter the 2FA code in the CODE section and click WRITE. Your wallet will open, 
 *      requesting confirmation. You must confirm!
 *
 *      Now find the WITHDRAW section and enter the password chosen in Step 1. Do not 
 *      enter the hash, only the exact same password in plain text, that was chosen.
 *      Pressing the WITHDRAW button will need one last confirmation for the wallet 
 *      to receive the clean ETH that was deposited.
 *
 * Disclaimer: This tool was coded to keep privacy. Make a fair use of it.
 * 
 * Happy Mixing!

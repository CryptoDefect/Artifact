Christmas Box     

$BOX

Welcome to 'Christmas Box', a DApp that captures the essence of the festive season, 

bringing the joy and excitement of Christmas into the world of decentralised applications. 

Inspired by the warmth and generosity of Christmas gift-giving, 

"Christmas Box" offers a unique and engaging experience for users in the blockchain space.



Free to Claim

In the spirit of giving, Christmas Box allows users to get $BOX Coin for free, with a total of 1,226 places available on a first-come, 

first-served basis, splitting 7.43% of the $BOX token.



Grab the Box

By participating in various activities we organize, you can get mystery boxes as rewards. All boxes will be open on the box day. 

Please note: Every 28 boxes can exchange for 1ETH!



FAQ

1. What's In The Box?

Users will get different amounts of $BOX tokens when they open the box.



2. How To Get Box?

Users will get BOX in two ways, 1. by trading and buy $BOX 2. by solving puzzles posted on social media.



3. How To Get Code? If I Enter Three Valid Codes, Can I Get Three Boxes?

Team sends out three puzzles a day via social media and users can get a box if submit the correct answer(code). Users can only get one box per day via code.



4. What Will Happen On The Box Day?

On box day (26th Dec), Users will get a bunch of boxes based on their $BOX balance, and 28 boxes can be converted to 1ETH. Details are as follows:

0.01e<balance<=0.1e equivalent, credit 2 boxes

0.1e<balance<=0.5e equivalent, credit 4 boxes

0.5e<balance<=0.8e equivalent, then credit 8 boxes

0.8e<balance<=1e equivalent, credit 16 boxes

1e<balance<=1e equivalent, then credit 24 boxes.



5. If I Have 28 Boxes, How Do I Get 1ETH?

Users can redeem 1 ETH by destroying these boxes on the box day.

If you have thirty boxes, you can open two boxes and remain the rest 28 boxes to redeem 1 ETH. Please note that opening and destroying boxes are irreversible.



6. Is There A Limit To The Number Of Boxes You Can Get?

There is no limit to the number of boxes you can get.



7. Is There A Limit On The Number Of Free Claims Per Day?

Every user can only claim once. Total 1,226 places available, first-come, first-served.



8. Is There A Time Limit For Getting Boxes?

All boxes should be collected before the box day.



9. Is This Project Taxable?

Yes, every transaction will be charged 5% for tax, including the $BOX tokens gained from free claim.

/**
 * @title Shared, filtered Minter contract that allows tokens to be minted with
 * ETH for addresses in a Merkle allowlist.
 * This is designed to be used with GenArt721CoreContractV3 flagship or
 * engine contracts.
 * @author Art Blocks Inc.
 * @notice Privileged Roles and Ownership:
 * This contract is designed to be managed, with limited powers.
 * Privileged roles and abilities are controlled by the project's artist, which
 * can be modified by the core contract's Admin ACL contract. Both of these
 * roles hold extensive power and can modify minter details.
 * Care must be taken to ensure that the admin ACL contract and artist
 * addresses are secure behind a multi-sig or other access control mechanism.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The following functions are restricted to a project's artist:
 * - updateMerkleRoot
 * - updatePricePerTokenInWei
 * - setProjectInvocationsPerAddress
 * - syncProjectMaxInvocationsToCore
 * - manuallyLimitProjectMaxInvocations
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Additional admin and artist privileged roles may be described on other
 * contracts that this minter integrates with.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This contract allows vaults to configure token-level or wallet-level
 * delegation of minting privileges. This allows a vault on an allowlist to
 * delegate minting privileges to a wallet that is not on the allowlist,
 * enabling the vault to remain air-gapped while still allowing minting. The
 * delegation registry contract is responsible for managing these delegations,
 * and is available at the address returned by the public immutable
 * `delegationRegistryAddress`. At the time of writing, the delegation
 * registry enables easy delegation configuring at https://delegate.cash/.
 * Art Blocks does not guarentee the security of the delegation registry, and
 * users should take care to ensure that the delegation registry is secure.
 * Token-level delegations are configured by the vault owner, and contract-
 * level delegations must be configured for the core token contract as returned
 * by the public immutable variable `genArt721CoreAddress`.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * @notice Caution: While Engine projects must be registered on the Art Blocks
 * Core Registry to assign this minter, this minter does not enforce that a
 * project is registered when configured or queried. This is primarily for gas
 * optimization purposes. It is, therefore, possible that fake projects may be
 * configured on this minter, but they will not be able to mint tokens due to
 * checks performed by this minter's Minter Filter.

    // `IERC20.transferFrom`. In these cases, the sender must have previously allowed the Vault to use their tokens by

    // calling `IERC20.approve`. The only deviation from the ERC20 standard that is supported is functions not returning

    // a boolean value: in these scenarios, a non-reverting call is assumed to be successful.

    //

    // - All non-view functions in the Vault are non-reentrant: calling them while another one is mid-execution (e.g.

    // while execution control is transferred to a token contract during a swap) will result in a revert. View

    // functions can be called in a re-reentrant way, but doing so might cause them to return inconsistent results.

    // Contracts calling view functions in the Vault must make sure the Vault has not already been entered.

    //

    // - View functions revert if referring to either unregistered Pools, or unregistered tokens for registered Pools.

    // they need not trust Pool contracts in any way: all security checks are made by the Vault. They must however be

    // aware of the Pools' pricing algorithms in order to estimate the prices Pools will quote.

    //

    // The `swap` function executes a single swap, while `batchSwap` can perform multiple swaps in sequence.

    // In each individual swap, tokens of one kind are sent from the sender to the Pool (this is the 'token in'),

    // and tokens of another kind are sent from the Pool to the recipient in exchange (this is the 'token out').

    // More complex swaps, such as one token in to multiple tokens out can be achieved by batching together

    // individual swaps.

    //

    // There are two swap kinds:

    //  - 'given in' swaps, where the amount of tokens in (sent to the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines (via the

    // `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens out (to send to the recipient).

    //  - 'given out' swaps, where the amount of tokens out (received from the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines

    // (via the `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens in (to receive from the sender).

    //

    // Additionally, it is possible to chain swaps using a placeholder input amount, which the Vault replaces with

    // the calculated output of the previous swap. If the previous swap was 'given in', this will be the calculated

    // tokenOut amount. If the previous swap was 'given out', it will use the calculated tokenIn amount. These extended

    // swaps are known as 'multihop' swaps, since they 'hop' through a number of intermediate tokens before arriving at

    // the final intended token.

    //

    // In all cases, tokens are only transferred in and out of the Vault (or withdrawn from and deposited into Internal

    // Balance) after all individual swaps have been completed, and the net token balance change computed. This makes

    // certain swap patterns, such as multihops, or swaps that interact with the same token pair in multiple Pools, cost

    // much less gas than they would otherwise.

    //

    // It also means that under certain conditions it is possible to perform arbitrage by swapping with multiple

    // Pools in a way that results in net token movement out of the Vault (profit), with no tokens being sent in (only

    // updating the Pool's internal accounting).

    //

    // To protect users from front-running or the market changing rapidly, they supply a list of 'limits' for each token

    // involved in the swap, where either the maximum number of tokens to send (by passing a positive value) or the

    // minimum amount of tokens to receive (by passing a negative value) is specified.

    //

    // Additionally, a 'deadline' timestamp can also be provided, forcing the swap to fail if it occurs after

    // this point in time (e.g. if the transaction failed to be included in a block promptly).

    //

    // If interacting with Pools that hold WETH, it is possible to both send and receive ETH directly: the Vault will do

    // the wrapping and unwrapping. To enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be

    // tokens from the Vault, deposit them, or assign arbitrary values to its `managed` balance (see

    // `getPoolTokenInfo`). This makes them extremely powerful and dangerous. Even if an Asset Manager only directly

    // controls one of the tokens in a Pool, a malicious manager could set that token's balance to manipulate the

    // prices of the other tokens, and then drain the Pool with swaps. The risk of using Asset Managers is therefore

    // not constrained to the tokens they are managing, but extends to the entire Pool's holdings.

    //

    // However, a properly designed Asset Manager smart contract can be safely used for the Pool's benefit,

    // for example by lending unused tokens out for interest, or using them to participate in voting protocols.

    // This concept is unrelated to the IAsset interface.
